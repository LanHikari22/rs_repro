# What is this?

This repository aims to capture my experiments when the need arises for me to create minimal reproducible examples. 
It aims to show the motivation behind the problem, the compiler response, and further explanations or corrections.

Entries in `repro_tracked` link to notes in note repositories. All `repro_tracked` code has its exclusive set of imported
crates if any and is made to be built fast on demand for demonstration purposes.
